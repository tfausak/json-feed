Photos always capture something \u2014 a moment with family or friends, visiting a new place, or just the everyday routine as it changes \u2014\u00a0and I want Micro.blog to provide a great user experience for photos, from filters to hosting.</p>\n",

There are a bunch of feeds in the wild now, <a href=\"https://jsonfeed.org/code\">as well as code and templates</a> for popular languages and web frameworks. The next step is support in feed readers, including brand new feed readers, which is <a href=\"https://json-feed-viewer.herokuapp.com\">already happening</a>.</p>\n<p>Feedbin and <a href=\"http://blog.newsblur.com/post/160982162270/newsblur-now-supports-the-new-json-feed-spec\">NewsBlur</a> both added support for JSON Feed. I like how <a href=\"https://feedbin.com/blog/2017/05/22/feedbin-supports-json-feed/\">Feedbin&#8217;s Ben Ubois puts it</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  One of the criticisms I\u2019ve seen of JSON Feed is that there\u2019s no incentive for feed readers to support JSON Feed. This is not true. One of the largest-by-volume support questions I get is along the lines of \u201cWhy does this random feed not work?\u201d And, 95% of the time, it\u2019s because the feed is broken in some subtle way. JSON Feed will help alleviate these problems, because it\u2019s easier to get right.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://micro.blog/\">Micro.blog</a> can also read from JSON feeds. I&#8217;ll be switching over all the hosted sites to prefer JSON. I&#8217;m doing that slowly to make sure there aren&#8217;t any issues with duplicate posts. (There shouldn&#8217;t be, but it&#8217;s something to watch out for with self-hosted sites if your post IDs change.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/manton/jsonfeed-wp\">The WordPress plugin</a> is <em>almost</em> in the WordPress directory. I&#8217;ll link to it as soon as it&#8217;s live, because it will make installing the WordPress plugin much easier.</p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://brooksreview.net/2017/05/an-interview-with-manton-reece/\">I talked with Ben Brooks over Slack</a> this week about Micro.blog and JSON Feed. From the chat:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Micro.blog and JSON Feed share a common goal, which is to encourage more blogging on the open web, and new tools that can make blogging easier. I feel like we\u2019ve gotten off course a little since the early days of blogging, with so many people now putting all of their writing into closed, centralized platforms like Twitter or Facebook. I think we can make it easier to own your own content, have your own domain name, and maybe learn from the UI in modern social networks too.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Slack makes for a really interesting interview format. Some of the spontaneity of a podcast, but with live editing and an automatic transcript. Similar to what Talkshow.im was trying to do before they shut down.</p>\n",
